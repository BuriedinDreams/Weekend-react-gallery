# Images Gallery App

This project taught me the Fundamentals of how to use React and how they interact with other pieces such as CSS and the DOM.

## Description

Duration: Weekend Sprint

The Image Gallery App uses React to render a list of images to the DOM, that each have their own like button. When the user clicks on a photo, the image disappears and text description is rendered. To bring the image back, the user can simply click on the now displayed description text. When the user clicks a like button, it increments the total number of likes for that image.
